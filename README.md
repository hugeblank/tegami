```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- corepack (which will automatically manage pnpm for you)

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t jebsite .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 jebsite
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm build`:

```
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with TailwindCSS 4 already configured with a beautiful default theme that supports both light and dark modes based on system preferences. The styling system includes:

- Modern color system using OKLCH color space
- Responsive design utilities
- Animation utilities via tailwindcss-animate
- Utility composition with tailwind-merge and class-variance-authority
- Shadcn component system for consistent, accessible UI components

## Technologies

### React Compiler

This template includes React Compiler (formerly React Forget) which automatically optimizes your React components for better performance without manual memoization.

### React Router Hono Server

The template uses React Router Hono Server for a flexible server runtime, providing a lightweight and performant foundation for your application.

### Shadcn Component System

Shadcn provides a collection of reusable, accessible UI components that are fully customizable and styled with TailwindCSS. The components are installed directly into your project, giving you full control over their implementation.

### tRPC + React Query

The template includes tRPC integration with React Query for type-safe API calls between your client and server. This setup supports server-side prefetching of data, ensuring optimal performance and SEO benefits while maintaining end-to-end type safety.

## Scripts

- `dev`: Start the development server
- `build`: Build for production
- `start`: Start the production server
- `typecheck`: Generate types and check for type errors
- `format`: Format code with Prettier
- `lint`: Lint code with ESLint
- `prepare`: Set up Husky hooks
